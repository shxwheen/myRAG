3,"What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges","The operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M was driven by several factors, including:

- Declines in disposable respirator demand year-on-year negatively impacted operating margins by 0.3 percent.
- Remaining organic growth/productivity and other impacts resulted in a net year-on-year benefit of 1.3 percent to operating margins, which was impacted by:
  - Benefits from strong pricing, spending discipline, and 2021 restructuring actions.
  - Manufacturing headwinds from global supply chain challenges, geopolitical impacts due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, as well as ongoing COVID-related challenges in China.
  - Increased investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability.

Operating margin can be a useful metric for 3M as it provides insight into the company's ability to manage its costs and maintain profitability. However, it may not be the most comprehensive metric for a diversified global manufacturer like 3M, as it does not account for non-operating items such as interest expense, taxes, and non-service pension and postretirement expense.",0.7383443636948676,742.2518730163574,1975.4879474639893,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf,,domain-relevant,3M,3M_2022_10K,10k

9,What is the FY2017 - FY2019 3 year average of capex as a % of revenue for Activision Blizzard? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Calculate (or extract) the answer from the statement of income and the cash flow statement.,1.9%,"To calculate the FY2017 - FY2019 3 year average of capex as a % of revenue for Activision Blizzard, we need to extract the capex and revenue data from the provided context.

From the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we can find the capex data:

- 2019: Capital expenditures (116)
- 2018: Capital expenditures (131)
- 2017: Capital expenditures (155)

From the Consolidated Statements of Operations, we can find the revenue data:

- 2019: Total net revenues 6,489
- 2018: Total net revenues 7,500
- 2017: Total net revenues 7,017

Now, we can calculate the capex as a % of revenue for each year:

- 2019: (116 / 6489) * 100 = 1.8%
- 2018: (131 / 7500) * 100 = 1.7%
- 2017: (155 / 7017) * 100 = 2.2%

Finally, we can calculate the 3 year average:

(1.8 + 1.7 + 2.2) / 3 = 1.9%

11,What is Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)? Give a solution to the question by using the income statement.,65.4%,"To calculate the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016, we need to use the income statement data.

Operating income for FY2016 is $1,493,602.
Operating income for FY2015 is $903,095.

Year-over-year change in operating income = (Operating income for FY2016 - Operating income for FY2015) / Operating income for FY2015
Year-over-year change in operating income = ($1,493,602 - $903,095) / $903,095
Year-over-year change in operating income = $590,507 / $903,095
Year-over-year change in operating income = 0.653 or 65.3%
