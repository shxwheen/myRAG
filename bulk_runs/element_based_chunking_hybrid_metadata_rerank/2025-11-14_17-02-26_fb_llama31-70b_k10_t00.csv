3,"What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges","The operating margin change for 3M as of FY2022 was driven by several factors, including:

1. Declines in disposable respirator demand, which negatively impacted operating margins by 0.3 percent.
2. Benefits from strong pricing, spending discipline, and 2021 restructuring actions, which resulted in a net year-on-year benefit of 1.3 percent to operating margins.
3. Manufacturing headwinds from global supply chain challenges, geopolitical impacts due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict, and ongoing COVID-related challenges in China.
4. Increased investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability.

Operating margin can be a useful metric for 3M, as it provides insight into the company's ability to manage its costs and maintain profitability. However, it's essential to consider the company's complex business structure, with multiple segments and geographic regions, which can make it challenging to interpret operating margin changes. Additionally, 3M's operating margin is influenced by various factors, including raw material costs, logistics, and manufacturing productivity, which can fluctuate over time. Therefore, it's crucial to analyze operating margin changes in conjunction with other metrics, such as revenue growth, segment performance, and cash flow, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the company's financial performance.",0.7371951814949081,610.5241775512695,1966.7198657989502,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf,,domain-relevant,3M,3M_2022_10K,10k

9,What is the FY2017 - FY2019 3 year average of capex as a % of revenue for Activision Blizzard? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Calculate (or extract) the answer from the statement of income and the cash flow statement.,1.9%,"To calculate the 3-year average of capex as a % of revenue for Activision Blizzard, we need to extract the relevant data from the statement of income and the cash flow statement.

From the statement of income, we can extract the total net revenues for each year:

- FY2017: $7,017 million
- FY2018: $7,500 million
- FY2019: $6,489 million

From the cash flow statement, we can extract the capital expenditures (capex) for each year:

- FY2017: $155 million
- FY2018: $131 million
- FY2019: $116 million

Now, we can calculate the capex as a % of revenue for each year:

- FY2017: ($155 million / $7,017 million) * 100% ≈ 2.2%
- FY2018: ($131 million / $7,500 million) * 100% ≈ 1.7%
- FY2019: ($116 million / $6,489 million) * 100% ≈ 1.8%

To calculate the 3-year average, we can add the percentages and divide by 3:

(2.2% + 1.7% + 1.8%) / 3 ≈ 1.9%

So, the FY2017 - FY2019 3-year average of capex as a % of revenue for Activision Blizzard is approximately 1.9%.",0.28077808067528864,1170.0260639190674,1766.5493488311768,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K.pdf,,metrics-generated,Activision Blizzard,ACTIVISIONBLIZZARD_2019_10K,10k

11,What is Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)? Give a solution to the question by using the income statement.,65.4%,"To calculate the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016, we need to first calculate the operating income for both years.

Operating income for FY2016 = $1,493,602 (from the income statement)
Operating income for FY2015 = $903,095 (from the income statement)

Now, we can calculate the year-over-year change in operating income:

Year-over-year change = ((Operating income for FY2016 - Operating income for FY2015) / Operating income for FY2015) * 100
Year-over-year change = (($1,493,602 - $903,095) / $903,095) * 100
Year-over-year change = ($590,507 / $903,095) * 100
Year-over-year change = 65.4%

15,What is Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO)? DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017). Round your answer to two decimal places. Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the balance sheet and the P&L statement.,93.86,"To calculate Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO), we need to find the following values:

1. Average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017
2. FY2017 COGS
3. Change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017

From the provided context, we can find the following values:

1. Accounts payable for FY2016: $7,175 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)
2. Accounts payable for FY2017: $4,786 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)
   Average accounts payable = ($7,175 + $4,786) / 2 = $5,980.5 million

3. FY2017 COGS: $111,934 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Operations)

4. Change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017:
   Inventory for FY2016: Not directly provided, but we can calculate the change in inventory.
   Change in inventory = FY2017 inventory - FY2016 inventory
   From the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we can find the change in inventory:
   FY2017 change in inventory = $-3,583 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)
   FY2016 change in inventory = $-2,187 million (from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows)
   Since we don't have the exact inventory values, we can use the change in inventory as a proxy for the change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017.
   Change in inventory = $-3,583 - $-2,187 = $-1,396 million

Now, we can calculate the DPO:

DPO = 365 * (average accounts payable) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory)
DPO = 365 * ($5,980.5) / ($111,934 - $1,396)
DPO = 365 * ($5,980.5) / ($110,538)
DPO ≈ 19.51

So, Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO) is approximately 19.51 days.",0.2183932552871404,618.9618110656738,2998.1889724731445,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf,,metrics-generated,Amazon,AMAZON_2017_10K,10k
16,What is Amazon's year-over-year change in revenue from FY2016 to FY2017 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)? Calculate what was asked by utilizing the line items clearly shown in the statement of income.,30.8%,"To calculate the year-over-year change in revenue from FY2016 to FY2017, we need to use the total net sales for both years.

Total net sales for FY2016: $135,987 million
Total net sales for FY2017: $177,866 million

Year-over-year change in revenue = ((FY2017 - FY2016) / FY2016) * 100
= (($177,866 - $135,987) / $135,987) * 100
= ($41,879 / $135,987) * 100
