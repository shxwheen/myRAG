15,What is Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO)? DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017). Round your answer to two decimal places. Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the balance sheet and the P&L statement.,93.86,"To calculate Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO), we need to find the following values:

1. Average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017
2. FY2017 COGS
3. Change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017

From the provided context, we can find the following values:

1. Average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017:
   Accounts payable in FY2016: $27,738 million
   Accounts payable in FY2017: $25,249 million
   Average accounts payable: ($27,738 + $25,249) / 2 = $26,493.5 million

2. FY2017 COGS:
   From the Consolidated Statements of Operations, we can find the FY2017 COGS:
   FY2017 COGS: $62,121 million

3. Change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017:
   From the Consolidated Balance Sheets, we can find the inventory values:
   Inventory in FY2016: $10,069 million
   Inventory in FY2017: $22,620 million
   Change in inventory: $22,620 - $10,069 = $12,551 million

Now, we can calculate the DPO:

DPO = 365 * (average accounts payable) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory)
DPO = 365 * ($26,493.5) / ($62,121 + $12,551)
DPO = 365 * ($26,493.5) / ($74,672)
DPO = 365 * 0.355
DPO ≈ 129.58

So, Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO) is approximately 129.58 days.",0.22058752442957116,177.11186408996582,2709.7628116607666,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf,,metrics-generated,Amazon,AMAZON_2017_10K,10k
16,What is Amazon's year-over-year change in revenue from FY2016 to FY2017 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)? Calculate what was asked by utilizing the line items clearly shown in the statement of income.,30.8%,"To calculate the year-over-year change in revenue from FY2016 to FY2017, we need to find the net sales for both years and then calculate the percentage change.

From the provided context, we can find the net sales for FY2016 and FY2017:

Year Ended December 31,
2016: $135,987
2017: $177,866

Now, we can calculate the year-over-year change in revenue:

Year-over-year change = ((2017 net sales - 2016 net sales) / 2016 net sales) * 100
Year-over-year change = (($177,866 - $135,987) / $135,987) * 100
Year-over-year change = ($41,879 / $135,987) * 100
Year-over-year change = 30.8%

So, Amazon's year-over-year change in revenue from FY2016 to FY2017 is 30.8%.",0.3153215454164658,149.8708724975586,2821.819305419922,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf,,metrics-generated,Amazon,AMAZON_2017_10K,10k

19,What is the FY2019 - FY2020 total revenue growth rate for Block (formerly known as Square)? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Approach the question asked by assuming the standpoint of an investment banking analyst who only has access to the statement of income.,101.5%,"To calculate the total revenue growth rate for FY2019 - FY2020, we need to use the total net revenue figures for both years.

Total net revenue for FY2020: $9,497,578
Total net revenue for FY2019: $4,713,500

The change in total net revenue is $9,497,578 - $4,713,500 = $4,784,078.

To calculate the growth rate, we divide the change in total net revenue by the total net revenue for FY2019 and multiply by 100:

($4,784,078 / $4,713,500) * 100 = 101.6%
