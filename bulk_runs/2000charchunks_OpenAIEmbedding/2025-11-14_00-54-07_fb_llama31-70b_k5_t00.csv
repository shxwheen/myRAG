DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017). Round your answer to two decimal places. Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the balance sheet and the P&L statement.,93.86,"To calculate Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO), we need the following information:

1. Average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017
2. FY2017 COGS
3. Change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017

From the provided context, we can find the following information:

- Accounts payable for FY2016: $27,738 (from the 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheets)
- Accounts payable for FY2017: $25,249 (from the 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheets)
- Average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017: ($27,738 + $25,249) / 2 = $26,493.5
- FY2017 COGS: $62,121 (from the 2017 Consolidated Statements of Operations)
- Inventory for FY2016: $10,069 (from the 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheets)
- Inventory for FY2017: $22,620 (from the 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheets)
- Change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017: $22,620 - $10,069 = $12,551

Now, we can calculate the DPO:

DPO = 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017)
DPO = 365 * $26,493.5 / ($62,121 + $12,551)
DPO = 365 * $26,493.5 / $74,672
DPO ≈ 134.41

So, Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO) is approximately 134.41 days.",0.22389232093955258,364.3319606781006,2568.9878463745117,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf,,metrics-generated,Amazon,AMAZON_2017_10K,10k

19,What is the FY2019 - FY2020 total revenue growth rate for Block (formerly known as Square)? Answer in units of percents and round to one decimal place. Approach the question asked by assuming the standpoint of an investment banking analyst who only has access to the statement of income.,101.5%,"To calculate the total revenue growth rate, we need the total revenue for both FY2019 and FY2020. 

From the provided context, we have the following information:

- Total net revenue for FY2020: $9,497,578 (in thousands)
- Total net revenue for FY2019: $4,713,500 (in thousands)

First, we need to convert these numbers to the same units. Since both are in thousands, we can directly use them for calculation.

Total revenue growth = (Total revenue FY2020 - Total revenue FY2019) / Total revenue FY2019
Total revenue growth = ($9,497,578 - $4,713,500) / $4,713,500
Total revenue growth = $4,784,078 / $4,713,500
Total revenue growth = 1.016 or 101.6%

Rounded to one decimal place, the total revenue growth rate is 101.6%.",0.27775496634827934,248.99697303771973,2186.903715133667,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/BLOCK_2020_10K.pdf,,metrics-generated,Block,BLOCK_2020_10K,10k
