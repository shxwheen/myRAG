3,"What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges","The provided context does not contain sufficient information to answer this question directly, as it does not explicitly state the operating margin for FY2022. However, it does provide information on the factors that impacted operating margins and earnings per diluted share year-on-year.

According to the context, the following components impacted operating margins and earnings per diluted share year-on-year:

- Declines in disposable respirator demand year-on-year negatively impacted operating margins by 0.3 percent and earnings per share by $0.29.
- Remaining organic growth/productivity and other impacts resulted in a net year-on-year benefit of $0.85 to earnings per share and 1.3 percent to operating margins, which was impacted by:
  - Manufacturing headwinds from global supply chain challenges
  - Geopolitical impacts due to the Russia/Ukraine conflict
  - Ongoing COVID-related challenges in China
  - Second quarter of 2021 benefit of $91 million pre-tax ($0.12 per share after tax) from the impact of the favorable decision of the Brazilian Supreme Court regarding the calculation of past social taxes
  - Increased investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability

Operating margin may not be a useful metric for a company like 3M, as it is a diversified global manufacturer with various business segments. The context mentions that business segment operating income margins decreased year-on-year due to increased raw materials and logistics costs, manufacturing productivity headwinds, investments in the business, and transaction-related costs associated with the announced divestiture of the food safety business. This suggests that operating margin may not capture the complexity of 3M's business operations and the various factors that impact its profitability.",0.700883857575097,448.61793518066406,2388.83900642395,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/3M_2022_10K.pdf,,domain-relevant,3M,3M_2022_10K,10k

11,What is Adobe's year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 (in units of percents and round to one decimal place)? Give a solution to the question by using the income statement.,65.4%,"To calculate the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016, we need to find the operating income for both years.

From the Consolidated Statements of Income, we can find the operating income for FY2016 and FY2015:

FY2016: 
Operating income = Gross profit - Operating expenses
= 5,034,522 - 3,918,851
= 1,115,671

FY2015: 
Operating income = Gross profit - Operating expenses
= 7,001,580 - 4,267,715
= 2,733,865

Now, we can calculate the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income:

Year-over-year change = ((FY2016 operating income - FY2015 operating income) / FY2015 operating income) * 100
= ((1,115,671 - 2,733,865) / 2,733,865) * 100
= (-59.2%)

So, the year-over-year change in unadjusted operating income from FY2015 to FY2016 is -59.2%.",0.281198819153667,733.1979274749756,1552.5193214416504,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2016_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2015_10K.pdf,,metrics-generated,Adobe,ADOBE_2016_10K,10k
