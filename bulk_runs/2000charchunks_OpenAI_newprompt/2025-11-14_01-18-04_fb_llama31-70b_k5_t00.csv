DPO is defined as: 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017). Round your answer to two decimal places. Address the question by using the line items and information shown within the balance sheet and the P&L statement.,93.86,"To calculate Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO), we need the following information:

1. Average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017
2. FY2017 COGS
3. Change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017

From the provided context, we can find the following information:

1. Accounts payable for FY2016: $27,738 million (from the 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet)
2. Accounts payable for FY2017: $25,249 million (from the 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheet)
3. Average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017: ($27,738 + $25,249) / 2 = $26,493.5 million
4. FY2017 COGS: $62,121 million (from the 2017 Consolidated Statements of Operations)
5. Inventory for FY2016: $10,069 million (from the 2016 Consolidated Balance Sheet)
6. Inventory for FY2017: $22,620 million (from the 2017 Consolidated Balance Sheet)
7. Change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017: $22,620 - $10,069 = $12,551 million

Now, we can calculate the DPO:

DPO = 365 * (average accounts payable between FY2016 and FY2017) / (FY2017 COGS + change in inventory between FY2016 and FY2017)
DPO = 365 * ($26,493.5) / ($62,121 + $12,551)
DPO = 365 * ($26,493.5) / ($74,672)
DPO = 365 * 0.355
DPO ≈ 129.58

So, Amazon's FY2017 days payable outstanding (DPO) is approximately 129.58 days.",0.22173569360286202,122.0541000366211,2495.3839778900146,/Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2019_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/ADOBE_2017_10K.pdf; /Users/shawheen/Projects/myRAG/data/test_files/finance-bench-pdfs/AMAZON_2017_10K.pdf,,metrics-generated,Amazon,AMAZON_2017_10K,10k
