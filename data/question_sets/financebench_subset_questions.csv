This new program authorizes the\nrepurchase of up to $10 billion of 3Ms outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In the first six months of 2023, the Company purchased $29 million of its\nown stock, compared to $773 million of stock purchases in the first six months of 2022. As of June 30, 2023, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the\nauthorization. In February 2023, 3Ms Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive\nyear of dividend increases for 3M.

The Companys annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive\nvesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the annual\ngrant stock-based compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter each year.\n3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense in 2023 to decrease by approximately $160 million pre-tax when compared to 2022, which\nimpacts cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. The year-on-year decrease in defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense for the second quarter and first six\nmonths of 2023 was approximately $38 million and $80 million, respectively.\nFor total year 2022, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $426 million and a benefit of $248\nmillion related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated\ndefined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $178 million.\nFor total year 2023, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $270 million while non-service pension and\npostretirement net benefit cost is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $125 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense\nof approximately $145 million, a decrease in expense of approximately $30 million compared to 2022.\nThe Company is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales,\nSG&A, and R&D.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 when compared to the same period last year. Decreases were\nprimarily due to lower year-on-year net costs for significant litigation to address certain PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher selling prices, spending\ndiscipline and restructuring benefits. These decreases were partially offset by higher raw materials and energy costs; manufacturing productivity headwinds; investments in\ngrowth, productivity and sustainability; and restructuring charges.\n62\n""}]",Industrials,10q,2023,https://investors.3m.com/financials/sec-filings/content/0000066740-23-000058/0000066740-23-000058.pdf

Operating cash flow ratio is defined as: cash from operations / total current liabilities. Round your answer to two decimal places. Please utilize information provided primarily within the balance sheet and the cash flow statement.,0.83,"The metric in question was calculated using other simpler metrics. The various simpler metrics (from the current and, if relevant, previous fiscal year(s)) used were:
